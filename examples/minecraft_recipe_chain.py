"""This example code file shows how crafterlib can be used to get
a sequence of steps needed to craft an item from an indirect ingredient,
another item that is not a direct ingredient to the first item.

If you have a Log for example and want to make a Pickaxe out of it,
then you can use the utility function get_recipe_chain to get a list
of ingredients and products for each crafting step inbetween these two
items.

This function is especially helpfull for getting complete recipes for
potions in minecraft which are made in multiple steps.
